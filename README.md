# Google Extension Test for LinkedIn

## Overview
This repository may switch between public and private at any time. This is a personal project designed to explore the capabilities and limitations of the extension.

LinkedIn's basic search functions are underwhelming, and I got tired of relying on Boolean searches while dealing with excessive promoted content in both the feed and job listings.

This extension is being developed to handle all of that.

Currently, promoted content is blocked by targeting containers labeled with **"Promoted"**, but I need to optimize performance, especially for users with older CPUs and limited RAM.

For now, please don't follow the project, as my focus may shift to other things.

Once again, this is just a personal project to test boundaries and see what’s possible.

## Project Goals & Stages
- **Dynamic Promoted Content Filter** – Enhance filtering to dynamically detect and remove containers labeled **"Promoted."**  
- **Navigation Support** – Ensure functionality works not just on direct load but also when navigating within LinkedIn.  
- **Toggle Switch** – Add a popup UI toggle to enable/disable the extension easily.  
- **Automatic Boolean Searches** – Automate complex LinkedIn searches to reduce manual effort.  
- **Dynamic Filtering** – Implement filters that adjust based on Boolean search parameters.

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Filtering might not catch all promoted content if LinkedIn changes its ad structure.
- Performance optimization is still in progress for older systems.
- Boolean search automation is planned but not yet implemented.

## Update Process
Updates will be released in batches, with each section being worked on individually. New versions will only be published as specific features near completion.

## Planned Enhancements
- Custom search presets for different job roles.
- UI improvements for better user control.
