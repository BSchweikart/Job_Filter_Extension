# Job_Filter_Extension
Google extension test for linkedIn. 

This repository can change from public to private at anytime.
This is a pet project to see what I can get this to do, or other words the limits of the extension.

LinkedIn's basic search functions are very lack luster. I was getting tired of doing boolean searches and all the promoted both in the feed and jobs.

This is being built to hand all of that.

Right now promoted content is blocked need to work on speed more for users that have older CPU's and not a lot of ram.

at this time please don't follow the project as my attention could be pulled to something else.

Once more this is a pet project I'm doing to test some limits.
